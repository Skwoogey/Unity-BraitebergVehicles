MovableCamera

	Allows to manipulate camera while in game. Use
	scroll wheel to zoom in and out ond hold right
	mouse button to drag camera around.
	
	PUBLIC PARAMETERS:
	
		Scroll Scale (float)
		
			Zooming coeficient. Denotes the change
			of camera window size per each scroll.
		

MovableSun

	A "Sun" layer object that you can move around
	while in game by holding with left mouse
	button and dragging around.

Vehicle

	Controls the car movement. Collects sensor
	data and adjusts each wheel's speed. Performs
	a movement after calculating speed.
	
	PUBLIC PARAMETERS:
	
		Default Accel (float)
		
			Default speed of each motor. Sensors
			will adjust and increase it or
			decrease it.
			
			NOTE: Acceleration can be negaitve.
				  Car can go backwards and rotate
				  in place.
		
		Left Accel (float)
		
			Current speed of left motor. It is
			being recalculated each tick. Should 
			be a private feild, but made public
			for monitoring purposes.
			
		Right Accel (float)
		
			Current speed of right motor. It is
			being recalculated each tick. Should 
			be a private feild, but made public
			for monitoring purposes.
			
		Body (Rigidbody2D)
		
			A "physical" body of the car. Made 
			for inner workings of a car. Do not
			change.
			
Sensor Pair

	A pair of similar sensors at the front of the
	car. Created to track and adjust both sensors
	together.
	
	PUBLIC PARAMETERS:
	
		Left Sensor (GameObject)
		
			An object that tracks left sensor.
			Made for inner workings of a car. Do
			not change.
			
		Right Sensor (GameObject)
		
			An object that tracks right sensor.
			Made for inner workings of a car. Do
			not change.
			
		Stimul (LayerMask)
		
			Object layers that sensors in this
			pairreact to. Can be multiple layers.
		
		FOV_Inner Angle (float)
		
			Angle in degrees that denotes inner
			feild of view (FOV) boundary of each
			sensor. Inner angle is measured from
			the front-looking vector of a car.
			
		FOV_Outter Angle (float)
		
			Angle in degrees that denotes outter
			feild of view (FOV) boundary of each
			sensor. Outter angle is measured from
			the front-looking vector of a car.
			
		Inverse Connection (bool)
		
			Whether sensors are connected to 
			motors in parallel or or in 
			crossed/inverse fashion. Each sensor
			can control only one motor (I lazy).
			
		Connection weight (float)
		
			Overall modifier of sensor values.
			Can create neagtive connections.
			
		Threshold (float),
		Max Value (float),
		Skewness (float)
		
			Variables of the formula that convert
			the distance value between sensor and
			stimul object to sensor value.
			
				SensorValue =
					MaxValue / (1 + exp(Skewness * (Distance - Threshold)))
					
				Threshold
					
					A mid-point value.
					Distance at which sensor is half
					trigerred 
					
				Max Value
				
					Scale value of a sensor. Adjusts
					how much sensor can change speed.
					
				Skewness
				
					changes skewness/smoothness of a
					graph. At high values graph is
					closer to digital reaction. At
					lower values graph is closer to
					linear reaction
					
SensorBase

	Base class for sensors. non-functional by
	itself.
	
Sensor Pos Distance

	Sensor that tracks position point of stimul
	objects. Does not care about object's size.
	Sensor calculates the distance to closest
	object.
	
Sensor Collider Distance

	Sensor that tracks collider of stimul
	objects. Stimul object must have a Collider2D
	component. Sensor Calculates the distance to
	closest object's collider.
